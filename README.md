Let's learn how<br>
<strong>N/B:</strong>This project assumes that you are confident with the basics of HTML 

<h3>Tools used?</h3>
Just html

# let's build this site in 10 easy steps 
you can use any editor of your choice but I'd recommend using vs code.
If you don't have vs code installed, download it here https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

<strong>step 1.</strong> Download and Install your editor https://code.visualstudio.com/Download<br>
<strong>step 2.</strong> Build up your html boilerplate, If you don't know how don't worry just press <strong>Ctrl + 1</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong><br>
<strong>step 3.</strong> Create your form and parse in your desired inputs<br>
<strong>step 4.</strong> After creating your input fields create a <strong>submit button</strong><br>
<strong>step 5.</strong> Make sure that all your inputs and your button are enclosed inside the form tag<br>
<strong>step 6.</strong>. Now this is where you use a library to handle your submission, since it is a pure html project we won't be using PHP or any onclick function<br>
There are many tools out there you could use to handle this but I'd recommend <h3>Formsubmit or Formspree</h3><br>
<strong>step 7.</strong> Goto : https://formsubmit.co/ 
No registration is required,scroll down and follow their instruction <br>
If you happen not to fully understand. then navigate to https://formsubmit.co/documentation<br>
<strong>step 8.</strong> when you are all set Copy your form tag and edit it in your code<br>
It'll look like this :
==> form action="https://formsubmit.co/your@email.com" method="POST">
    Then replace your@email.com with your own email that You'd like to receive the submission response with.<br>
<strong>step 9.</strong> Push and host your site on github... learn how here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrJ4oN1u_8<br>
<strong>step 10.</strong> share your site's URL to your desired audience and start recieving their response straight to your mail.<br>
